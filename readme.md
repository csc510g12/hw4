Note: some of the records have the age field missing:

They are treated as invalid and not counted when calculating average age.

How to run scripts:

- [Task 1: Killing an Infinite Script (task1.sh)](scripts/task1.sh)
- [Task 2: Text Processing (task2.sh)](scripts/task2.sh)
- [Task 3: Titanic Data Analysis (5.awk)](scripts/titanic-first-5-lines.sh)
- [Task 4: Passenger Class Analysis (class.awk)](scripts/titanic-class-awk.sh)
- [Task 5: Average Age Calculation (age.awk)](scripts/titanic-age-awk.sh)
- [Task 6: Survival Rates by Class (live.awk)](scripts/titanic-live-awk.sh)

Since all the group member are required to do the the same tasks, we just keep one set of scripts in the main branch. See also other [branches](https://github.com/csc510g12/hw4/branches).
